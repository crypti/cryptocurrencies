## Building

The JSON list, the currency icons, and parts of this README file are auto-generated
from the coin list made available by the [cryptocompare coinlist API](https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/data/coinlist/),
and can be updated automatically by running:

```
$ npm run build
```

:bulb: Note that this build routine synchronously downloads the currency icons and saves them to the `images` directory. This means
that the build routine takes a few minutes, since it has to process thousands of images.
