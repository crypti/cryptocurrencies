## Building

The JSON list, the currency icons, and the Markdown Table shown above (in this readme) are auto-generated
from the coin list made available by the [cryptocompare coinlist API](https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/data/coinlist/),
and can be updated automatically by running:

```
$ npm run build
```

> :bulb: **Important**
>
> The standard build routine synchronously downloads the currency icons and saves them to the `images` directory. This means that the build routine takes a few minutes, since it has to process thousands of images. Use `npm run fast-build` to skip existing images that may have already been downloaded.
