WAIT! Are you requesting a change to a specific cryptocurrency?

If yes, keep in mind that this list is generated automatically from the data on the cryptocompare API (via https://www.cryptocompare.com) so if you are requesting that a change be made to a specific currency, then the change would need to be made upstream on the cryptocpmare API. To do this, you would need to contact the support team at crytocompare (Visit https://www.cryptocompare.com
and click on the 'Contact us' link in the footer).

But if the change you need is already on the crytocompare API and not on this list, then you can submit a PR after you run `npm run build` to ensure that the current list is up-to-date. Or open an issue with a request to update the list.
