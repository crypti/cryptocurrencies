<!--

WAIT! If you are attempting to submit a PR that makes a manual change to currency. Please don't.

This list is generated automatically from the data on the cryptocompare API (via https://www.cryptocompare.com) so if you are requesting that a change be made to a specific currency, then the change would need to be made upstream on the cryptocompare API. To do this, you would need to contact the support team at cryptocompare (Visit https://www.cryptocompare.com
and click on the 'Contact us' link in the footer). Once the data is on the API, then you can submit a PR after running `npm run build` to ensure that the current list is up-to-date.

If you submit a PR with a manual edit to any specific currency, it will be closed, because any manual changes you make would be overwritten the next time the list is auto-generated, this is why the data needs to be on the API, because that is our single source of truth for this list.
